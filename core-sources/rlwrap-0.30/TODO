TODO:

SHORT-TERM:

- fix the BUGS (cf BUGS)

- Better filename completion (quoting(?), sensible handling of filenames 
  that contain word-breaking characters)

LONG-TERM:

- rlwrap could use input- and output filters - i.e separate processes that
  digest user input and possibly interact with rlwrap to update the
  completion word list - or even to do the completion itself. 
  This would subsume some functionality now handled by
  rlwrap (like the -r and -l options)
